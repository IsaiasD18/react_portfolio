  ## Description
  The task is to create a portfolio using my React skills, which will help my portfolio to set apart from other portfolios that donâ€™t use the latest technologies.
  Being a web developer means being part of a community. This portfolio will help me share my projects while i'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer and also to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.
